The Dartastic! mod expands on Terraria's darts, which only has 4 weapons and a handful of darts. This mod aims to make them into a custom class, that's viable and fun to play! Currently, this mod adds 31 new weapons, 12 new darts, and 4 new accessories. This mod is still unfinished, as we are yet to make armor, better accessories, and a new NPC, but a full playthrough might still be viable.
